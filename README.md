# IB CS IA - TinFoika - Web Development 2024

This web development project started before I even entered the IBDP, as a way of streamlining the processes required in the Thespians Honour Society at my school. This ReadME will be both a guide to coding this website should you wish to, as well as a Web collection for certain components of my IBDP documentation.

## On Editing

First off, Congratulations for being brave, or cynical. Both are good traits for a high school programmer. First of all, **this website is my pride and joy**. I would very much appreciate it if you didn't destroy it. To prevent you from doing so, you may ONLY get permission to do this if I invite you into this repository. To do this, please email me at li.gf.aaron@gmail.com, and cc either Mr. Holland or whichever theatre teacher takes up his staff following his untimely demise (or retirement, which would be lame. If you are unfortunate enough to see the day Holland retires, please tell him Aaron Li thinks he's lame).

I also very much hope you read the Notion Documentation before you decided that the best course of action was to wish to modify this website.

### For Local Development
  
  `npm install`

This is the first line which you should be running in the terminal on your folder, wherever you are developing. Otherwise, almost all of the code will be underlined in red. Also do understand that this is in Typescript, and thus is a little bit weird.

I also do hope you know how to pull from github. Otherwise, just copy this:

  `git clone https://github.com/TinFoiKa/saspxthespians.git`

As a unfortunate victim of the Microsoft pipeline, I recommend VScode. Not MS Visual Studio, but [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93).

Happy Editing!
